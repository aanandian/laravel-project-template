## About

Larastart is a Laravel based application template to speed up the powerful app development specifically designed by Kanekes.

All the advantages of Laravel are here, we just add a little to make it more suit with the project initiation in general.

## Requirements

The minimum requirement by this aplication template that your Web server supports PHP 7.1.3.

## Installation

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this aplication template using the following command:

~~~
composer create-project --prefer-dist kanekescom/larastart larastart-app
~~~

If you have PHP installed locally and you would like to use PHP's built-in development server to serve your application, you may use the serve Artisan command. This command will start a development server at http://localhost:8000:

~~~
php artisan serve
~~~

## Learning

Laravel is based on Laravel. All documentation and tutorials are still appropriate, there are only additional preinstalled features.

## License

The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
